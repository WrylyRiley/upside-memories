# Upside Memories

I wanted to compile all of the wonderful things people wrote about Upside in the @general channel before Slack was turned off forever. Here's what everyone has to say about us and our time working together.

## Will Ley

I would also like to add a thank you as well to all of the leadership for going to the mat for us. You took it as far as we could and didn't let the dream of it put us in harms way. Thank you for that and for creating an amazing space of caring and support!

## Julie Gelb
I know that I’m not alone in saying that I’m incredibly thankful for my Upside experience.

I started as a social media intern right out of college and I wouldn’t change a thing about the last 5 years. Everything that has happened has helped shape me into the person I am today – and the Upsiders I’ve been able to work with along the way are a huge part of that.

When I interviewed at Upside’s 1602 office, I remember seeing Jay Walker walking down the hall and waving a child size magic wand. I remember seeing @tscottcase running around whooping and hollering excitedly. Then I interviewed with @genevieve and it sealed the deal. I knew this was the place where I ~~wanted~~ needed to be.

I would list every one of you and every memory, but this message would become far too long for anyone to read. So I will leave it at **this…**

**Thank you all for changing my life for the better. I am forever grateful.**

This is difficult to write, and I'm sure I'll forget something, or not find the best words to use, but I'm reminded of an old Upside mantra — don't let done be the enemy of shipped — and will keep writing (apologies in advance if this gets long/incoherent/rambly).

My last job search began with a kubernetes job dc Google search, soon after I attended a Google workshop during a DevOps Days DC event and was introduced to the tech. I  wanted to learn more about it, since it appeared to be powered by magic (I now know that it is, indeed, powered by magic), but unfortunately my last employer had no interest in using :party-k8s: It had been 2 years and I was about ready to move on anyway (my awesome mentor sadly left), so it was a good time to find a new gig. I am so grateful that Upside accepted me. You gave me more than I ever expected from a company. I'll add on to the broken record — this is a truly special group of people. Culture is everything.
I've unfortunately worked with some not-so-nice people in the past, and one Upside recruiting video I'll never forget features our old colleague Rav, who said "Upside doesn't hire jerks." I'm not sure why that stuck with me as much as it did, but he was right. This is such a supportive and kind crew. Work can be challenging, but to me, it's all worth it when it feels appreciated. I am a huge fan of HeyTaco! and how it allowed us to easily express our gratitude/appreciation/thanks for being extra awesome today. Thank you all for making me feel so appreciated and loved.

I knew pretty quickly after I first walked into those doors to interview at 1602 L that I wanted to work at Upside. It was loud(remember the headphones benefit?), chaotic, and people were happy and excited; just the most incredible and infectious atmosphere. It was a Tuesday, and I quickly learned about what came to be one of my favorite Upside traditions, Tasti Tuesday! I'm sure I was a nervous wreck, since I loathe interviews, but after I started to munch on a small plate of treats, I was put at ease.

Upside is a place where we can all bring our true selves to work. I am proud to work for a company that embraces our differences. I loved coming into work with a tie dye t-shirt on, wading through the sea of suits and crew cuts in DC. That dichotomy always amused me. It is so refreshing to work somewhere that puts so much effort and value into diversity and inclusion. I don't want to work with a bunch of other white men in some weird echo chamber. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to find a company that respects D&I as much as Upside. We also showed incredible vulnerability during fireside chats, and I hope I have a leader again someday who is strong enough to show such raw emotion while delivering tough news.
For my whole life, I preferred to be called Christopher, but never really bothered to correct, so I was called Chris by most friends. I decided to change that at Upside, and it might sound small, but having christopher@upside.com meant so much to me, rather than some generic clr14@upside.com address. It's amazing how little things like that can affect someone. Onboarding at Upside was incredible—the best I've ever experienced. I don't think I signed a single piece of paper! Did we even have a printer in the old office? Now THIS is a startup!!

I started to learn how to cook in college, when I didn't have any money and had an intern's salary. Years later, after learning everything mostly on YouTube, I took a cooking class at a Sur la Table and really enjoyed it. I wanted to find another class, and was pleasantly surprised that there was a cooking school, CulinAerie, about a block away from our office. I walked over during lunch one day to check out the space, and met Wendi, who was happy to answer my questions. As fate would have it, Wendi was CulinAerie's kitchen assistant coordinator, and her assistant for the next day's class was unavailable. She asked if I was free, and the next day I worked my first shift after work. Over the next two years, I assisted over 50 classes, learning a tremendous amount and eating incredible food along the way. I wanted to practice as much as I could, and am so happy that I was able to host a few Tasti Tuesdays and share my love of cooking with you. I apologize for the extra steps/stairmaster/whatever you needed to do to make up for those extra calories :hug:

When times got scary during the BLM protests in DC, it was touching to see the outpour of support from colleagues offering to house fellow Upsiders. Even now, it's touching to see everyone spring into action; supporting one another to assist finding that next stepping stone on our career journey.

For the majority of my time here, I was with the SRE crew, and had the privilege to work alongside Jay (Gorrell) and Dennis, who taught me everything I know while having a ton of fun building pretty kickass infrastructure. I remember being home on a call during a retro or standup or something and cracking up at Dennis' jokes and my Mom couldn't believe that I was at work, laughing and chatting away. She told me what a gift I had to be so happy with my job, and she was right.
It will be difficult for all of us to find a job as great as Upside. The bar has been set extremely high. Thankfully, the job market seems ready for good workers, and I hope everyone knows how special and awesome they are, and doesn't feel the to rush into anything right away. Know your worth! :purple_heart:

Thank you thank you thank you thank you for an amazing 4 years that I will cherish forever. I love you all so so much. If you are ever in:hershey_kiss: Hershey :hershey_kiss: or want to visit, please let me know! My parents love you by extension and told me that you are welcome to stay in our home. It would bring me so much joy to share a meal with you.
Will, I'm sorry that we never got to do a Star Wars-themed lunchtime trivia. That was :100: Upside; a fantastic suggestion.

in no particular order, I will miss (and I'm sure I'm forgetting so much)

## LC Cunningham

Hey y'all - chiming in to say that the leadership team did an amazing job with everything this week. I've been through layoffs before and I went through one that legitimately wrecked me - my confidence, my ability to believe in myself, etc - but this was so much the opposite. If anything, I feel confident that I will find something new because I have an entire army of supporters behind me - my FELLOW UPSIDERS! Everything about this company was phenomenal and I am not exaggerating when I say I've never been happier at another workplace. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to find somewhere as supportive and amazing as here.

Thank you to my PM squad, specifically @tracy, for taking a gamble on me and slotting me into a role that I may not have been qualified for :buzzfeed-lol:  but for giving me a chance to either sink or swim (I think i swam, idk). I've never felt so comfortable or supported by a team of people before! Thank you to everyone on commercial for being my home for my first few months at Upside! And honestly just thank you to everyone in this slack. Upside is a truly magical place to work and I'll cherish my memories with all of you for a very long time :slightly_smiling_face:

Don't be strangers! Add me on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook (i am never on it) whatever - if you find me, add me. I won't be weirded out haha.

Admittedly, I am not good at answering texts sooOOOO.... roll the dice. I might respond :ac_roverlaughhaha:

This should be a really sad day, but I am honestly feeling very at peace. We built really cool stuff, most of it worked, and we had fun while doing it. I think that's what matters.
:delight: :crank: :vibe: LOVE YOU ALL!

## Emily Gerrity

Upside gave me such an incredible opportunity. I  was being mistreated at my previous position, and it was such an amazing and surprising experience to be able to work with such a diverse and empathetic team. I learned so much, and loved everyone I worked with. You are all the best, and I know we will all go on to do great things. 

## Jalena Hey

Reading all these messages really reinforces how irreplaceable the people and culture is at Upside. I am so appreciative of having given this opportunity (@tracy ty!!!!!!!) and so thankful for having such an awesome and supportive team. Thank you for taking the chance on me! Thank you Valk Team and Design Team I love ya all! I have learned so much and today is such a sad day, but also so uplifting to know how much support there is. Thank you for also always welcoming Sammy to all the meetings (usually shirtless lol). I know he will miss all the meetings and morning standups too! I hope I can find a job that makes me feel as important and gives me the amazing work life balance that I need. :heart::cool_crying:

Please KIT !

## Michele Cardoso

I’m not as good as all of you to put my feelings into words at this moment, so I’ll summarize to `"Thank you all! You are all amazing and wish you all the best, because you all deserve it! I'll f** miss you!"`  :purple_heart: (edited) 

## Emily Gumbulevich

I can't write this without tearing up so here we go --

I haven't had a lot of cheerleaders in my life, but joining Upside was like joining a team chock full of daily cheerleaders. Upside is supportive like I have never felt or seen before, and I am so grateful to have experienced it. You are all absolutely wonderful humans and my life is so much better now that I know you.

About 8? years ago, someone I respected told me I would be a terrible product manager. That I couldn't do it. I almost didn't try after that - I figured that person knew more than me so they must be right. But @tracy and @tscottcase never stopped believing in me and helped me eventually become a PM.

If you told me then that I would have been leading a group of PMs at Upside someday, I would have laughed at you. But because Tracy and Scott didn't give up on me then, and gave me a shot a year ago to show what I've learned since then, it really happened. I got to work with the best group of people I've ever seen all together at once. I can't even begin to thank them for believing in me and helping me grow. It is not surprising that they were part of the leadership team that made this company so awesome. Cheerleaders attract cheerleaders.

Thank you @tracy and @tscottcase for not letting me give up on Product. Thank you Upside for showing me that it is possible to find a company with a team full of cheerleaders and brilliant, funny, and kind people. :purple_heart: You have all shown me what I can do and have taught me so much about myself, and I am forever grateful!

Okay Connor is looking at me like "Why are you crying? What happened?" so here -


I've said it 100x since Monday but I will help anyone with anything - recommendations, resume reviews, references, connections, let me know. I'm a cheerleader for life.

Please keep in touch!

## Francesca Dapiran

Although my time at Upside wasn't nearly as long as I would have liked, I know the impact was huge.

When I first started back in November last year, I was coming from a company with basically zero culture so I was so excited when Upside, despite being remote, put a huge emphasis on their culture and employees. In turn, everyone worked together, lifting others up. I remember telling friends and family that I had finally found my dream job. It will be difficult to find a group of individuals so willing to give and show support like this again and for this reason, my heart is breaking.

To happy thoughts... everyone at this company are some of the most capable and passionate individuals I have ever met and I have no doubt will do amazing things. For this reason,  I fully intend to stalk all your LinkedIns to follow on what will undeniably be incredibly journeys. I am forever grateful to have joined Upside and met all you amazing humans :purple_heart: :wink: :upside:

## David Lee

:upside: fam, i’m going to try and keep this short since i’ve DM’d most of you, but also because my fellow colleagues have eloquently said what a lot of us feel…a mixture of immense sadness but also incredible gratitude of what we built, but more importantly, what we had in each other.  short backstory, i’m a born and raised Cali guy who volunteered in 2017 to leave behind the familiar to take a year off of work to move out to the East Coast to help kickstart a new church plant, which focuses on college ministry.  After getting things up and running, I had to to find a job thereafter.  I’ve previously only worked for large corporations like at&t, peoplesoft, and an electric utility company, but my risk averse self took a chance to be part of a startup at the suggestion of my childhood friend, Kenny Choi (former awesome Upsider) who referred me here.

I had a lot of feelings of insecurity and nervousness upon getting onboarded as I met so many bright and talented people on my first team (shout out of team :valkyrie2: !) and i was afraid that i wouldn’t be able to cut it.  so those first few months were a little tense and intimidating, which probably showed as I stayed in my awkward :shell: but over time i realized that everyone here cared and looked out for each other, which came from the top.  that sense of security i grew to experience enabled me to come out of my shell just a tad (hence the music videos i’ve created in the past) and enabled me to grow here.  so…thank you all for the memories.  Here’s one last message from my girls who have had so much fun being part of the :upside: family as they asked about all the interesting and amazing co-workers their dad got to have these past 2 years.  Much love, wish you the very best, and God bless!

## Michael Burkman

Never been good with sentimentality, but here's one of my favorite songs that I think fits the feeling right now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGDjO9kuKyY

## Kris French

Quite simply, this company renewed my hope that people can come together and do their best to do the right thing all of the time. Before Upside I worked at a number of organizations who swore that employees were family, that they cared about their impact on society and wanted to use their influence for good, and that DEI were core values - and did anything but. Upside never made those promises. We just did it.

I'm sad that what I gained from Upside won't be available for others. I'm sad at the high likelihood I won't be able to find our like again. And I'm sad that having a talented, hard-working group of people who were always doing the right thing wasn't enough to make it.

I've held to the claim for years that Security is a people job, and not a technical one. You all taught me that the two are actually inseparable. Reliable people who are easy to work with create and use reliable technology that's easy to work with. Security work usually feels like banging your head against a wall, begging, and selling your heart out for the smallest of superficial gains. It was never like that here. Hell, we went from 0 to fully PCI certified in just a few months. Truly incredible. I remember when I first started, Emily and I would have 1:1s where I'd tell her I didn't need anything, didn't have any worries, that we were all set for the next week. She was always astounded at my cool, but it was really because of all of you. Thank you for giving me the easiest security job I've ever had. I'll never forget you for it.

## Riley Bauer

I remember when I applied to this Upside. I saw a recruiter reach out to me on LinkedIn with a single word, and though “…that looks familiar”.  I did some sleuthing and reached out to my then friend of 3 years, Liz Bruce. I asked her if she worked there, and we started talking immediately about what it was like, how much I’d fit in, and how it would really springboard my career. Once I began the application process, a very patient @adrian kept rescheduling my phone calls because my carrier was blocking them, even going as far to give me the time to change my cell carrier just to take your calls! 

I walked into 1TC for my final, in-person interviews, and I knew immediately this was the place for me. The contrast I saw between Deloitte and Upside was staggering. I didn’t know a job would be so fun, engaging, and rewarding. I was coming from projects where I wasn’t appreciated for my ideas or my hard work. I was coming from a company that valued complacency and box-checking over innovation, and I was coming into it thinking someone here made a mistake. Why hire me, a General Assembly grad with less than two years under their belt? I learned pretty quickly that my imposter syndrome was just kicking into overdrive.

I completed my lofty goal of meeting every single person here in my first few months, and you all showed me what a healthy, open, diverse, inclusive workspace looks and acts like. The culture here exceeded my wildest expectations. We drank beer and whiskey when travel policy was released, and played the win song whenever we got a new client. It was an amazing time while it lasted. Even during the pandemic, I’ve felt nothing short of the same level of connectedness. Sure, it wasn’t always easy, and we didn’t have quite the same atmosphere, but everyone was willing to connect with you at any time. Everyone was genuinely interested in how you were, and what your life was like. It really made 2020 bearable  

I have gained so much knowledge since joining Upside, and I know that I was able to contribute as much as I could to the team and the culture. Between taking on emails head first, to working with such amazing people on theming and frontend cleanup, My time here was truly enriching, and this was hands down one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. 

I sincerely hope I get to work with all of you again in the future. Good luck. I’ll miss you

## Marius Mogyorosi

I want to echo a couple things @Kris and @Riley said:

- I’ve worked at companies with much higher risk profiles, and where security was intrinsic to their mission and product, and still Upside was an incredibly smooth experience rather than a sisyphean one. People defaulting to collaboration for the benefit of all is just a marvel to behold :sparkles: :vibe:

- I’m sure I would have had a much, much worse time trying to work elsewhere throughout the pandemic. I joined Upside near the end of 2020 and even then a new job and the rest of my time here was much less stressful than at the previous place. I can’t imagine where I’d be mentally if I couldn’t count on the flexibility and support I found here.

Although I haven’t been here too long and didn’t get to meet anyone in person, I definitely felt like part of the team and believe my contributions had a positive impact - which is impossible in Security without the support of everyone else. I’ve made friends and nerded out to :vim: and :python: to my heart’s content! :laughing:

## Monica Bacican

This sucks so bad and I’m going to miss all of you AMAZING people

Keep in touch plz

## Brooks Lawrence

I'll never forget the day I came in for my in person interview 2 Octobers ago. I was sitting in the waiting area and was asked to sign in with an iPad but when I tried to sign in it wouldn't work and asked for the Apple ID. So I walked into a conference room and none other than @tracy was there working away...I asked for help and she went 0 to 60 to lend a hand, we shared a few jokes and the rest was history.

I was lucky enough to be in the office for 3 months and change before we made the move to remote. And after being at Upside for a week, it felt like a year, everyone was so nice and helpful and I felt like I was truly at home with family. After we went remote it was challenging but I never felt like we lost an ounce of that vibe :vibe:.

It's sad that it's over but I'm happy I was lucky enough to be apart of this amazing team and will miss you all! I wish everyone the best of luck and hope to see you at some point in the future personally or professionally.

Keep in touch

## Tara Stigall

It's fitting that I'm currently on a tarmac in a :airplane: heading to higher ground :snow_capped_mountain: . Every person I know that has asked me, How's work?, over the past year has heard nothing but love & praise for this company & people. I had some quite grim things happening in my personal life over the past year and being with Upside sincerely brought joy into my life at times when it was really difficult to find elsewhere. When I interview in the future, Upside will always get a nod in the 'Tell me about a time...' answers because it set a very high standard against all other experiences.

Special shout outs:

- To the Engineering teams that let me invade their space & take a seat on their team bench.
- To every PM that asked, But why?, for every feature I asked for & challenged me to dig deep to bring answers.
- To Apolloans for making me feel old & curious about Pokémon.
- To my CX/DTX fam, there aren't enough words... You put a smile on my face every damn day.
- Thank you @tscottcase @jenmoyer @tracy @mike.debnam @Cris for creating & nurturing this culture.
- Thank you all Upsiders for bringing your energy, humor, support, and determination.
- 
Please never hesitate to shoot me a text, an amazing tiktok, a dumb meme, or yes, even a travel question. And if you ever find yourself in Kansas City, hit me up for a :coffee:️ or:beer:.

## Mic Vachon

There are truly no words that would do justice for how grateful I am to have been part of the Upside family. Thank you to everyone who helped make this ride something I will remember and be grateful for for the rest of my life.

## Robert Townley

On my first day, someone–I don’t remember who… that day was a BLUR–told me that a month at Upside is like a year somewhere else, both in terms of things you learn, and the connections you make. Like that person’s name, I also don’t remember much about the next two weeks. I just remember waking up later knowing Typescript, how airline inventory systems worked, and which of the three Chipotles near 1 Thomas Circle would be mobbed at lunchtime.

I do remember my third week, because that was when the office shut down. Also the 5th week. That was the one where I found out Upside wanted me to work on a telecardiology mobile application with the WILDEST architecture imaginable. Then it’s back to a blur for three months but suddenly I know Kotlin and the Twilio API, and feel a deep and meaningful friendship with 7 people I’d never met in person.

I remember rejoining Valkyrie, and worrying that I wouldn’t mesh as well with the team as I did with my Heartbeat Health crew. I was worried that my job was now to maintain two microservices for every term in aviation (one experience service and one vendor service). But I also remember just... sort of trusting that Upside would make things work out.

The next memory blur was a pretty long one. I attribute it to pandemic malaise and new parent sleep deprivation. At the end of that one, months have passed. I’ve learned more about software development than I had in 5 years at my previous company, and Valkyrie now feels like home. Also I’m a dad now, and whatever distant worries I had about “my company not supporting me through new parent life” have been replaced by “the slow burn that comes from knowing my coworkers want to see June more than me”.

During normal times, getting that support from your company is empowering and restorative. But these weren’t normal times, and working for Upside got me through the pandemic. I spent months locked in a small apartment, worrying about how to keep COVID away from a pregnant partner and then an infant daughter. Even more so than Animal Crossing, this company’s understanding, enthusiasm, and devotion to each other was a shining light that made each day enjoyable. I’m a world-class forgetter, but I’ll never forget that.

I deeply wish I’d had more than 18 months with you all, but I’m grateful for every second. Thank you to the leadership team for making Upside the best company I’ve ever worked for. Thank you to the unyinz, mobsters, 86ers (NOT YOU), and darkly joyous team lead who made Valkyrie what it was. And from the bottom of my heart: thank you all for 1.5 years of cranking and vibing. The delight was mine.

## Ania Hoffmeier

When I accepted my offer at Upside, I had just turned down a full time remote position because I wanted an "in person" job. Unfortunately the pandemic had other plans and while stepping into business travel at the height of a global pandemic was risky, I am SO incredibly grateful to have met and worked with all of you. Absolutely no regrets. I'm going to miss you all very much!! Good luck and K.I.T. :cool_crying: :purple_heart: :upside:

## Will Freeman

LONG WALL OF WORDS: Well, in the words of Michael Jackson, “this is it.” I wish I could be saying goodbye under different circumstances but that’s the thing — I’m not really one for goodbyes:sweat_smile:I believe every ending is just an opportunity to start again but the point I wanna make is that Upside has been an unforgettable place to work during this summer. Hunting for an internship position for a year while balancing school and trying not to get killed by a global pandemic ain’t the most fun, which is why I will be grateful for this opportunity until the end of time. I won’t forget that email from Adrian asking me if I’d like to join the team for the summer; I literally was jumping up and down like I was watching Revenge of the Sith for the first time:joy:

I’ve met some amazing people here, ones I hope to call friends at this point. @tscottcase, you’ve built such an amazing legacy and I’m forever inspired by your grace, wisdom and humility (as well as your jokes during every Daily Edition) @Indira, you’re a shining light to this place and you’ve been such a fantastic mentor over the summer. Even though I still have much to learn, I’m glad I learned what I did from you. Every 1-1 I got with everyone here when I started; @Warren Zentz, @genevieve, @Francesca Dapiran, @jenmoyer, @Isra, @Brandy, @kristen, @tracy etc. has been unforgettable and I’m glad I got to see some of the amazing things that you all did here. @Kris, @Marius and Matt (whom I doubt will see this but he’s here in spirit), every team refresh was very relaxing and I did see a lot of cool security stuff that I hope to carry onto my future career. You guys are freakin rockstars and thanks for your help with all the access requests I  handled with some amount of grace:sweat_smile:. @adrian, @Cris your energy every meeting I got to see y’all in was extremely infectious and there’s no words I can think of to express my gratitude towards you guys for being so great throughout the whole summer. @burkman’s jokes, @christopher’s trivia games and culinary skills, @Claycia’s tie-dye party, @Isra making fun of me for not knowing what a VCR is (obviously it’s a city in Venezuela:face_with_rolling_eyes:), Jami being the best DJ ever and every other third thing here just attributed to what I now consider to be the best summer I’ve ever freakin had in my life. Above all however, I won’t forget how terrifying it was to DM every person here asking for their Mac info only to be responded with some of the kindest and most welcoming people I’ve had the honor of meeting in my freaking life. Also, every coffee talk was fantastic (@kathryn.rhoads and @Michele Cardoso, I owe y’all one)

I’m not the best when it comes to meeting new people; I’m usually very shy. But man, after being here for the time I have, I think I can confidently go out into the world with the same energy that Upside has pretty much injected into me. You all have been amazing and I’m sorry if I missed a name or two — it was really hard to put this into words to begin with. Speaking of, there are really only eight choice words I feel is necessary to close this out with:
May the Force be with you all. Always.

## Jeffrey Moore

I'll try to keep this short. Upside was such a life saver for me. Moving through multiple states over the course of a year (literally moving from PA, to VT, NH, MA and finally CT) took a lot out of me and then I got laid off (due to COVID) and found myself in a job hunt and I hadn't even really got settled yet. I had a pretty long job hunt last summer and it wasn't until I found Upside and met @tracy, @kristen, Elizabeth, Sabrina, and Jessica that I knew I had found an amazing design team. I instantly felt at home. And that feeling continued with each and every Upsider that I had to privilege of meeting. You are such wonderful people and the crazy thing is I haven't even gotten to meet you all. This has been such a transformative experience for me. Thanks so much the this opportunity and I wish you all the best. Feel free to keep in touch

## Noah Lubin

To be brief, Upside renewed my faith in the world through compassion, empathy, integrity, honesty, and great leaders.   It was a short time for me but so much learned.  

Thank you all!


## Holiday Poems written by Catherine Guarnieri
### 2019
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the office
Not a feature was shipping, just to be cautious;
JIRA tickets were left in their swim lanes with care,
With hopes that the backlog might just disappear;

The engineers were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of scrum-donuts danced in their heads;
And Scott in his Nikes, and Jay suited up,
Had just done one final bi-weekly roundup.

When out on the terrace there arose such a clatter,
Design sprang from their corner to see what was the matter.
Away to the window flew UX in a flash,
Stepped over the legos and threw up the sash.

The Upside logo all bright and aglow,
Gave a beacon to travelers way down below.
When what to their wondering eyes did appear,
But one CTO and eight engineers!

With wit and command of full stack complexity,  
They knew in a moment that she must be Emily.
More rapid than slack messages her architects they came,
And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

"Now, Bellerose! now, Burkman! now Tony and Sean!
On, Emily! on, Shehroze! on, Liz and on Dhaman!
Heads down we go until baseline is ours,
Now code away! Code away! Code away hours!”

And then, in a twinkling, they heard in the lobby,
The prancing and pawing of Wesley and Rami.
Design drew in their heads, and turned right around,
Just in time to see Meeks & little Pepper abound.

Lin was dressed as a Dino, from his head to his feet,
And Toast was all laughing in a moment so sweet,
“A bundle?” Yelled G, “no one knows what that means!”,
And “HAH” triumphed Monica, as she blocked the Philippines.

Jason’s eyes were a-twinkled at growth, so merry!
“Do your dishes”, said Danielle, there’s no kitchen fairy.
While John Reed only wants our expenses all done,
There’s a battle in DS for the best nerf gun.

“Bounce” goes our data guru Mr. Holmes,
On his way to meeting the other eight OMs.
Chris and his labs are talking AI and meats,
While Bolak is listening to Buble though his Beats.

“Now is good” is a phrase for 2019,
As we all take a break to close out ’18.
Even Scott is okay with the holiday break,
So long as its TripActions we soon overtake.

He finished his iced tea, to his team gave high fives,
And began to reflect on Upside’s past strides.
I heard him exclaim, before he skipped out of sight—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"

### 2020
'Twas the last day of demos, when all through 1 Thomas,
Not a Zoom link was working, not a’one in the office;
Allison was hanging on the phone line with care,
In hopes that Matt Harrison soon would be there. 

The sales team was nestled all snug in Cockpit;
While questions from leads they answered with wit;
And Jason in UNTUCKit, and Brian B in his tank,
Had just played the ‘win’ song from their shared office Crank,

When out on the circle there arose such a clatter,
Jami sprang from her desk to see what was the matter.
Away to the window Phil flew like a flash,
Tore down the blinds and threw up the sash.

Traffic was snarled on the streets down below,
And the headlights gave off a nice wintery glow,
When what to our wondering eyes did appear,
But a gang of Bird scooters bearing eight engineers,
With a tall-haired lead so lively on Slack,
I knew in a moment it must be Sean Bolak.

More rapid than RAPID the PMs they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
_"Now, Birin! now, Sarah! now David and Izzy!_
_On, Roxanne! on, Emma! Jamie, Lauren & Tracy!_
_To Players Club we go! To the next phase we chug!_
_We groomed away! groomed away! groomed away bugs!"_

With Alpha we proved we could get people to fly,
When under Flight Centre codes they took to the sky;
So up to the rooftop the team leads they flew
With the bags full of macbooks, and Erin Lord too—

And then, in a twinkling, they heard from the lobby
Loud cheers from a man with a major shoe hobby.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the hall, he came with a pink tea to be downed.

He was dressed all in purple, from his head to his toes,
And his clothes were all covered with Upside logos;
A group of new Upsiders he had flanking his side,
Our new CEO, he was beaming with pride.

Their eyes—how they twinkled as their journey begins, 
From tacos and all-hands, to wellness and #wins,
Life here at Upside brings joy and good cheer, 
As we grow as a team a little each year.  

There’s Sapphire and Ruby brimming so full of genius, 
And designers that make a user’s experience seamless. 
Data Science heads down on all things Rec engine, 
And CX with an eye on every customer’s session. 

Scott’s contagious, kind smile drawn up like a bow,
As he looked all around and bellowed ‘How about now!’ 
There’s work still to be done, from policy to trains, 
But nothing we can’t do, with our collective brains. 

He sprang to his desk, to his team gave a whistle. 
And away we all flew, a final 2019 dismissal. 
But we heard him exclaim, as we dipped out of sight, 
_“Happy 2020 to all, may it be full of Crank, Jive and Delight.”_
